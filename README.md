# PDFSessions
A javascript for Adobe Acrobat Reader that enables the user to save sessions (groups of open pdfs) and later restore them. Based on the script by Andrey Kartashov found in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12689154/adobe-acrobat-reader-tabs-saving-and-autoloading.

Just add the script the Javascripts directory under your Adobe Acrobat Reader instalation, restart the application and use the new "Save Session", "Open Session" and "Delete Session" options on the Window menu.
